# **Automated Report Generation: Student Scores Report Generator**

The **Student Scores Report Generator** is a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of analyzing and presenting student performance data. This tool is particularly useful for educators, school administrators, and anyone involved in academic assessment who needs to quickly summarize student scores in a professional format. By leveraging the simplicity of CSV files for data input and the versatility of PDF for output, this project provides an efficient solution for generating comprehensive reports.

**FILES INCLUDED IN THE REPO:**
- automated_report_generation.py (Main Python File)
- File.csv (Sample CSV File)

**TOOLS/TECH. USED:**


**KEY FEATURES:**
1. **CSV Data Input**: The application reads student data from a CSV file, which is a widely used format for data storage and exchange. The CSV file must contain at least two columns: `Name` and `Score`. This allows users to easily manage and update student information using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

2. **Data Analysis**: Once the data is read, the application performs several key calculations:
  - **Total Score**: The sum of all student scores, providing a quick overview of overall performance.
  - **Average Score**: The mean score calculated from the total scores, offering insights into the general performance level of the class.
  - **Highest and Lowest Scores**: Identifying the best and worst performances helps educators recognize top achievers and those who may need additional support.

3. **PDF Report Generation**: The application generates a well-structured PDF report that includes:
  - A clear and professional title.
  - A table displaying each student's name alongside their score, making it easy to read and understand.
  - A summary section that highlights the total, average, highest, and lowest scores, providing a concise overview of the data.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: The program prompts users to input the name of the CSV file, making it accessible even for those with limited technical skills. This feature ensures that users can operate the application without needing to modify the code.
